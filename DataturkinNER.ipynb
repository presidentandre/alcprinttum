Even if I didn&amp;#39;t do a lot of the things that people there are reporting (DUIs, violence, abuse, not contributing to anything in the family, etc.), I still see a lot of drinking me there.

Now I have time in the morning to make breakfast and lunch, read, and relax before I have to leave for work. I never knew I liked mornings until about 60 days sober. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve begun focusing on things that I have neglected for a long time, like my physical health. I have the patience and focus I need to eat well, and I no longer put off bedtime because I know I will have a morning! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve become more aware of the kinds of social situations that are actually good for me and those that I really have no desire to be in. My reactions and feelings about people/situations aren’t blunted by alcohol, so I actually know how I feel. This has been painful sometimes, but it has lead to growth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think about alcohol constantly anymore. When it crosses my mind it is usually just a gentle passing thought. Sometimes I get triggered and want a drink, but this generally passes quickly. A few times the urge to drink has been strong and painful. These moments have been hard, and my partner and therapist have been extremely helpful in processing those feelings. I’ve had extreme anxiety in some situations and wanted to drink to numb it, but I didn’t. I’m grateful that I didn’t, because I never would have learned certain things about myself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Overall these past 100 days have been illuminating, life affirming, strange, occasionally isolating but often connective .

I wasn’t an every day drinker, but I also wasn’t a totally in control kind of drinker. If I had one drink, I’d have at least 4-5. I black out easily and get bad headaches. I decided to quit on a Saturday after buying a bottle of wine (and drinking) and my favorite 24 pack of beers the night before. There was no real plan, just a switch that flipped and I felt like enough was enough. In the beginning posts like these really helped me. So here are some things I’ve noticed in a year of sobriety. \\n\\nMemory - it has gotten a lot better in a year. My memory slipping was one reason I quit drinking. The brainfog really lifted around 5 months. \\n\\nJoy - I started truly enjoying music and shows more.

Eventually, I became a closeted drunk, drinking up to a full bottle of vodka or whiskey a day along with several beers to wash it down. No one, not even the people closest to me had any idea of the extent of the alcoholism.   \\n\\n\\nI hate hospitals and I avoid them at all costs. I found a little lump in my neck years back and ignored it. Started having chest pains with radiating pain down my arm, ignored it. Then the pain in my right side started, but I ignored it. I\\'ve been working on getting a handle on my drinking for about a year now with minimal success. I eventually opened up to my wife about my problem and she has been a tremendous help. She helped me find some therapists (none of which really helped that much) but the biggest thing was she gave me the confidence to try anti-depressants for the first time. I\\'ve been on them for about a month and a half now.\\n\\na few weeks ago I started getting tired. Really tired. Sleeping ALL day tired. I started sweating nonstop, to the point I was soaking the sheets and blankets. I decided I needed to get checked out, something was surely wrong. I nutted up, packed a bag, and went to the ER.\\n\\nI told them everything. I told them about the level of my drinking, and I told them about all the issues I was having. The chest pain, the lump, the tiredness, and the pain in my right flank. They did an ECG and they took my blood to test. I was preparing myself for what I knew was going to be life-changing news.\\n\\nThe doctor eventually called me in to look over my test results. Nothing. My blood work came back fine except for dehydration and my ECG showed no problems at all. I was stunned. The doctor talked to me about my drinking a little but it basically boiled down to \"You\\'re getting away with it for now, but you really need to stop\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t believe I got a clean bill of health.

              " ('I\\'m at 50 days sober (my counter is slightly off - timezones?) and feeling mighty happy about it! When I started I thought I was taking a \"break\" although I knew I really needed to stop, and now I\\'m at a full 50 days! I want to share some of the changes i\\'ve experienced in these 50 days (and remind myself why it\\'s so much better not unscrew the cork of the wine I bought on day 5):  \\n\\n\\n**Sleep**: I am sleeping so much better than I have for years. I get about 8.5 hours a night now, and I don\\'t wake up every hour or so throughout the night. What\\'s even better is that I don\\'t get the 4am anxiety that \"my life is going nowhere\" / \"everyone I love might die\" / \"I\\'ll always be alone\". I thought that kind of paranoid anxiety was just what everyone had at 4am, and I certainly never thought it was booze related - turns out, it was! Now I wake up completely refreshed at 7am and it makes me *so happy*.\\n\\n**Guilt:** I was constantly doing things when drunk that I felt guilty and/or stupid about after - whether it was am embarrassing comment I made or drinking so much I didn\\'t remember getting home. I\\'ve now had a succession of parties and weekends where I remember everything, and more importantly, I didn\\'t do anything stupid!\\n\\n**Skin:** I cannot believe how much my skin has changed in these 50 days. It started being noticeable quite early on but still keeps improving. My red cheeks have gone back to a normal shade, the darkness under my eyes has vanished and I wake up looking really quite healthy and glowy. The slight downside was around day 30 when I got a pretty nasty acne flare up around my chin and jawline - I\\'ve read this is a rebalancing of hormones after losing the estrogen heavy alcohol - which hasn\\'t gone 100% but it\\'s improving, and even with that my skin still looks much better than before.\\n\\n**Time**: I have gained so much time in my life, it\\'s unbelievable. All the evenings I spent bored drinking, and then hours the next day feeling shitty, tired and hungover are gone. So now I have all this time to read books, get outside, meet people for coffee, and go to workout classes I used to be afraid to try out.\\n\\n**My body:** I definitely developed a sweet tooth almost as soon as I stopped drinking, which was a surprise to me having never craved sweets before (this is apparently quite common, as alcohol has so much sugar, that the body gets a bit confused when cut off from its supply). What is even more surprising is that I haven\\'t actually gained any weight from my new obsession with ice-cream. In fact, I\\'ve dropped about 2lbs overall and all my jeans are looser (and I most certainly look better in them). Even more...My body composition scales tell me I\\'ve lost 5lbs of fat and gained around 3lbs of muscle! \\n\\n**Money:** I don\\'t think I realised how much my wine habit was costing me. For the first time in a long time I am getting to the end of the month with money to spare. I\\'m still going out, but dinners are *much* cheaper, lengthy bar bills are a thing of the past, and I no longer spend a stupid amount of money on delivery food to feed my hangovers when I\\'m too lazy to shop and cook.\\n\\n**Socialising**: I seem to be much more social now. I used to have plan my week taking into account likely hangovers e.g. wild night with friends on Friday, so block out Saturday for the hangover and stay at home with wine and a movie. Now I plan morning coffee dates, walks with friends and their dogs, I even played miniature golf one Saturday morning! I also enjoy that time spent with people much more, I feel like I\\'m making a better connection with them.\\n\\n**Energy**: My energy levels and motivation to do things is significantly higher. I used to beat myself up about not doing enough, about being lazy, and watching too much TV, but I still never bothered to make any changes. Now I actually get up and do things because I feel buzzing with energy. And when I\\'m not feeling so energetic, I know it\\'s because my body is genuinely tired! So, I don\\'t beat myself up anymore, I just go with it and get under a blanket with Netflix so I can recharge.  \\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a complete list, there are many other benefits that keep me going, but I think it\\'s enough for now. It definitely hasn\\'t been a walk in a park either but I\\'m focusing on the positive today, so I really hope someone early on in their journey reads it and feels a little more motivated to carry on. And, in another 50 days I hope I\\'ll have another list of wonderful things I\\'ve discovered about being sober :)',\n",

I was drinking every single day and didn't even know that night that I was going to quit.

I had saved half a glass of cheap wine so I could get up early and down it before anyone else got up. Instead, I dumped it.\\n\\nI made it through that first six months with a savings tracker app, a subreddit and IWNDWYT, and sheer spite. It was hard. I cried a lot.

I started a business. I found full-time work on top of that. But I still wasn't ready to commit to never drinking again. Six months, I told myself. On my birthday I can have a drink or two.\\n\\nSix months rolled around. It was a week before my birthday, and I decided two things: I would spend all of 32 sober and I would seek out therapy. I started therapy with a substance abuse therapist and started working through the triggers for my drinking. We tackled things like social anxiety and the constant overwhelm I was feeling and more.\\n\\nAround the 1-year sobriety mark, I started seeing a second therapist to start working through the things I was actually dealing with that the drinking was masking.\\n\\nAbout that time, I was diagnosed with ADHD and we started the teeter totter of balancing out my depression and anxiety medications. I started seeing an actual psychiatrist rather than just my PCP.\\n\\nI started getting out again as COVID numbers started dwindling. I read books about boundaries and attachment theory and jealousy. I had hard conversations with everyone around me.\\n\\nI have been sober for TWO YEARS\\n\\n24 months\\n\\n104 weeks\\n\\n730 days\\n\\n17,520 hours\\n\\n1,051,200 minutes\\n\\n63,072,000 seconds\\n\\nSome of those seconds dug their nails into my chest and ripped out pieces of me that I didn't know needed destroying.

Or the time that I was so excited to be back at church that I drank the wine without thinking about it and sat in church staring at Jesus and the cross and tasting it in my mouth.\\n\\nI've struggled with faith along the way, which is why AA didn't feel right for me thus far. It's unrelated, but it has made reading the 12-steps feel a little ridiculous.\\n\\nSo two weeks ago, I downloaded the Little Book: A Collection of Alternative Twelve Steps and pursued creating my own guiding principles.

Because really: I couldn\\'t make a better choice for my happiness, my health, my work and my relationships.\\n\\nSomething about where I\\'m from. I am 25 (f) and a year ago I had already made many quit attempts. I wasn\\'t your typical \"alcoholic\" (just a riotous party girl according to most). I could go weeks without it, but if I drank, I drank a lot. And almost daily I thought: wouldn\\'t my life be better without alcohol? \\n\\nI felt  that I had to stop for a year. But I was so scared. Afraid of what I would encounter. Afraid I\\'d be boring without alcohol. Afraid my boyfriend wouldn\\'t like me anymore without alcohol.\\n\\nBut, with my boyfriend\\'s encouragement, I stopped drinking a 350 days ago.\\n\\nIt felt like I was gaining momentum. My self-development progressed in great steps. When I look back now, the first half year was mainly about rediscovering myself. Who am I without alcohol? How do I break old patterns? How do I overcome fears? With the help of therapy, plant medicines, and dear friends and family, I made progress and learned to deal with problems that I had numbed with booze for years. The following six months I could reap the benefits. I felt free in myself, confident, my career, passions and relationships progressed by leaps and bounds.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t always easy. It was fucking confrontational at times. I was no longer the fun party girl I used to be. sometimes I just didn\\'t feel like it and went home. I learned that was okay.\\n\\n**Now a list of all the things I learned and did during my year sober :)**\\n\\n\\\\-I rediscovered my style. A year ago I tried to hide, and wore clothes that everyone wore. Now I have a unique style which I love.\\n\\n\\\\-I conquered my Instagram fear (I\\'m an artist and never dared to post my work on Instagram.)\\n\\n\\\\-I followed my dreams and did drama school auditions (also something I never would have dared before I quit).\\n\\n\\\\-I made a great website for my artworks.\\n\\n\\\\-I started rollerskate dancing and became quite good at it\\n\\n\\\\-I learned to have persistence\\n\\n\\\\-I overcame my fear of failure/rejection. I just DO things now and don\\'t care so much if I fail.\\n\\n\\\\- I healed my sexual traumas for the most part. I am now finally  in touch with my own body and my own excitement in stead of only pleasing others.\\n\\n\\\\-I did San Pedro and healed a lot of childhood shit\\n\\n\\\\-I started to open up to my boyfriend and show my real self. I finally dared to show my creativity to him.\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m in contact with my boundaries and wishes and dare to express them.\\n\\n\\\\- I am no longer guided by separation anxiety. (In my relationship I never dared to choose for myself out of the anxiety he would leave me.)\\n\\n\\\\-I made my first documentary!\\n\\n\\\\-I started a video collective with a good friend\\n\\nI learned Photoshop &amp; final cut pro\\n\\n\\\\-I learned who I am as an artist, what my trademark is and just went for it instead of staying vague so  everyone would like me).\\n\\n\\\\-Learned to freely be myself without alcohol. Sometimes crazy and wild and dancing on the tables, sometimes shy and boring.\\n\\n\\\\-I bought a good laptop for myself which I take care of properly (never would do that in my booze periods).\\n\\n\\\\-Learned to communicate nonviolent and vulnerable. Also learned to reflect on myself. (Very good for my relationships haha.)\\n\\n\\\\-Felt -and still feel- an enormous drive, energy and productivity. Busy with chasing my dreams everyday.\\n\\n\\\\-Stopped binge eating and started eating healthy naturally.\\n\\n\\\\-Letting go of people and things that no longer fit\\n\\n\\\\-Working productively, consistently and purposefully on my biggest dream\\n\\n\\\\-feel MUCH closer to myself and much more comfortable in my own skin\\n\\n\\\\-Don\\'t do things or see people that I don\\'t really like\\n\\n\\\\-I finally feel my body and feelings in stead of just living in my head\\n\\n\\\\-Feel that I\\'m alive\\n\\n\\\\-More acceptance and flow\\n\\n\\\\-Way more zest for life\\n\\n\\\\-I lost weight and look much better\\n\\n\\\\-Embraced my naturally curly hair\\n\\n\\\\-Made a lot of creative work and learned a lot in it\\n\\n\\\\- learned playing ukulele\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHave a great day &lt;3\\n\\nIWNDWYT\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nps.

              " ('Hey there,\\n\\nI have convinced myself that I might be alcoholic although my family and wife tell me I\\'m not and I would like to see if anybody else has felt something similar.\\n\\nLittle bit about myself; I am a 30y old male, married, smoker, suffering from hypochondria (illness anxiety disorder) and chronic anxiety disorder. No history of alcoholism in my family. I have my own company, few employees and consider myself pretty okay.\\n\\nWhen I was 21 I moved abroad and I was constantly very depressed and had a lot of mental issues due to rough childhood and arguments with my father. Since beer was in that country\\'s culture, I was also drinking a lot of beer. 6 pack (33cl) for sure a day and sometimes even more. I guess I used booze as a coping mechanism which is already bad itself but being a teenager I never thought about it this way.\\n\\nSo fast forward two years; I graduated and moved back home when I was almost 24. Bought my own apartment and got married. I significantly cut down drinking without even knowing it and was having few beers or gin &amp; tonics almost every evening to take the edge off. Of course there were times when I drank more on the weekends, events or when one of my family member got extremely sick etc but nothing like I did abroad. I\\'ve never set limits to myself for example \"tonight I only drink two beers\". Never thought about getting a drink in the morning or anything like this. Usually after few beers I feel I\\'ve had enough and I just wanna go to bed or switch to water.\\n\\nSo fast forward to this year (2022). In mid July 2022. I told myself that no drinking during weekdays for a month and I got to say it felt pretty weird for the first two weeks; I used to watch Netflix and having a beer, doing barbeque and having a beer, but was able to do it just fine. I don\\'t know if that is an addiction or just a habit my brain got used to. I simply changed booze to flavored water. I don\\'t know exactly what a craving is but some moments I was thinking to myself \"I could really use a drink right now!\". I\\'ve had few drinks on Friday and the weekend.\\n\\nThe thing is that I\\'ve always had that weird sensation in my stomach; it is not pain or an illness (I\\'ve done every possible tests there is). It feels like my stomach is heavy or it is restless and it is super uncomfortable. Best way to describe this is like it\\'s the \"butterflies\" but they don\\'t feel like good butterflies. It goes away when I go to my dog\\'s training for example or ride my motorcycle. But I do have a lot of things going on right now (building my first house for example) and the feeling has gotten a lot worse. I guess I didn\\'t notice the feeling as much because alcohol took it away.\\n\\nI\\'m currently staying with my parents, until my house gets ready, who drink wine every evening (couple of bottles for sure) and they\\'ve done it since I was a teenager so I guess this is somewhat normal for me because I saw this behavior while growing up. There\\'s always booze in the fridge here but I don\\'t have the urge to go and drink it. After discussing this with my wife, she asked me: \"Do you think your father is an alcoholic?\" I said no. Then she said I have nothing to worry about. But my stupid brain has convinced me that I have alcohol disorder and now I\\'m just afraid to drink at all although I would like to have an occasional drink from time to time.\\n\\nI have done all the tests to see if I have AUD but all of them say I don\\'t.\\n\\nDo you guys think I am overthinking this?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all in advance!',\n",

              " (\"I'm struggling so bad. It was my birthday yesterday and I hated every second of it. I spent most of the day crying, the night before and now again this morning.  \\n\\nI was supposed to go to a gig but I couldn't face it. I don't want to do anything or see anyone but I'm so fucking lonely. My boyfriend is amazing but I'm being a nightmare. He's the only one there for me, I've cut myself off from everyone else and I don't have any friends. He bought the gig tickets, he was cool about me pulling out last minute. He offered to take me to dinner instead but I couldn't get over not having a glass of wine. We went for a walk even though his back hurts. He bought me flowers and chocolates and wrote a lovely card. And I'm seething in anger. I hate myself. I don't know how to look forward to things without drinking. I can't see a silver lining or a light at the end of the tunnel. I want to die. \\n\\nI'm trying to get into therapy, I'm on medication. I should have started the process earlier but now that I really, really need it I have nothing arranged. I'm waiting to hear back from my psychiatrist. But I can not stand to be in my own head, I'm being just awful to my boyfriend and I can't seem to stop. My reflex is to get away from him, create space so I can stop blaming him for everything that is actually my fault. But if I'm away from him I will drink and make things 100% worse.  \\n\\nI've done this now. If I choose to drink again I'm choosing to end my relationship. I made the decision, I said I want to do this but I don't really. I need to, yes. And I want to stop the dangerous, excessive binges but I'm absolutely in pieces at the thought of never being able to have a drink on my birthday or at like a wedding or Christmas. I'm not a naturally social person, I'm an awkward, ADHD, autistic mess and alcohol just takes all that away. It makes me want to be with people and do things. It helps me look forward to things.  \\n\\nI feel not that I have nothing to look forward to now but that I'm incapable of looking forward to anything. Incapable of happiness, incapable of contentment even. The only relief I feel is from wailing and sobbing and punching myself. I'm so sick of having to try so hard, to constantly fight, to have to work so hard to just get out of bed. The only things motivating me are negative, looking back on the destructive nature of my drinking. On the harmful, irresponsible, selfish behavior it created.  \\n\\nI have no job, my work history has been so sporadic and my mental health so poor that I can't hold down a job longer than a few months and there's no way I'm in a good enough way to start something new right now. As I said, I don't really have friends. I used to but my boyfriend didn't really get on with any of them so over the years it's been easier to just let them go. I only enjoy talking to people when I'm drinking so I'm not exactly dying to get out there and meet new people either. But that means all day, every day alone with him while he works from home. It's not healthy. I have my family but I'm not really close with any of them except my sister who is very busy with work and a young child. I don't want to lean any harder on her than I already do. Our mother died from alcohol abuse 10 years ago and I don't want to be honest about my struggles either in case of retraumatising them. And it's hard to admit that things are so bad.  \\n\\nI have hobbies, I'm good at arts and crafts and I've been trying to set up a business selling stuff for 15 years. But I can not get motivated enough to really do anything with it. I only got diagnosed with ADHD three years ago and I'm still struggling massively with motivation. I didn't realise how important a tool alcohol had become, even when not drinking I could use it as a reward. We have dogs, so I get out with them but honestly it's more stressful than anything facing the neighbours after crying loudly. I don't drive, I don't trust myself not to have a panic attack and swerve into a wall or oncoming traffic. All I do is walk dogs and clean the house. I feel so trapped in my own bullshit web and feel like blaming everyone but myself, though there is no one else to blame.  \\n\\nThank you for being a place where I can rant and say how I really feel. I will keep trying because what else can I do? I attempted suicide when I was younger and seeing what that did to my family along with mammy's death, its just not an option no matter how I feel. I'm just hoping and praying to a god I don't believe in that I can get a shred of optimism back and maybe one day be happy. I might post tomorrow full of love and gratitude but this is my reality right now, those moments feel more forced and fleeting than anything. I hope they become more frequent, I really need them to.\",\n",

Give that person the right mindset!\\n\\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\\n\\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\\n\\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis post goes up at:\\n\\n- US - Night/Early Morning\\n- Europe - Morning\\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\\n\\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat's up sober peeps!\\n\\nI post this DCI while eating pizza and playing Mass Effect, all while in my pajama pants.

I either bounce back immediately or then struggle with a more prolonged but less severe relapse.\\n\\nThis past week I finally recognized that there has been one trigger for every lapse/relapse in recent years—literally the same same thing over and over and over. I think I already knew that, but finally said, “That’s it!

The only really good things that have happened are that I quit drinking and I finally got a new car. My summer so far: My father-in-law almost died and I missed a week of work caring for him, my car died, my AC went out (for 10 days, when it was 105F!), my pet got sick and I paid over $800 in vet bills, my sister went to jail (which wasn\\'t really a bad thing, but stressful nonetheless), and the kicker - I found out yesterday that my husband has a cyst on his brain and will most likely need brain surgery. I was so very tempted to buy a bottle of wine last night to drown my sorrows. I ended up buying and eating a huge bar of chocolate instead. I guess I just needed a place to vent. Thanks for reading.
